# CodingGreen Advent of Code 2021

Here is my source code for Advent of Code 2021. Got up to speed quickly using my [advent-of-code-runner template](https://github.com/CodingGreen/advent-of-code-runner) developed last year. I've used a reasonably functional style, include defining some of my own functional utils such as `pipe`, and tried to keep things DRY when I have the time! The code itself doesn't use any libraries though I am tempted to try using [RamdaJS](https://ramdajs.com/) next year!
